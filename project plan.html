<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Our goal is to get the new costumers through the clear and informative web design. Join us together in CossiePlay online / offline store through our web site in order to purchase the future costumes to enjoy the art of cosplay yourself. It is also essential in order to attract the amateur cosplayers in the work to answer the questions that may arise at the time of cosplay. Not only words and texts but also reference images and templates are needed to create a well-designed and informative website. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>We use Guests Flow Map to measure site success by demonstrating how how guests are taking part in with the site their visit per week.The interface can be redone to show how particular sorts of clients go through the site. For example returning guests may go straight to the business' online store, while new clients may first go to an About page to get information on the business and its offerings. Enhancing site flow is about making it quicker and less demanding for guests to bounce starting with one page then onto the next, and changing parts where activity is being kept down. For instance, if new guests are leaving the site subsequent to perusing a page about the business' offerings, there might be issues with how the data is introduced. It is also because of there is no unmistakable suggestion to take action to show where guests ought to go next. This foundation data guides business on what parts to address and after that permits us to evaluate the success of their fixes.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The site is to speak to a wide range of cosplayers regardless of their age, sex, race, stature, weight, as I need to demonstrate that individuals can cosplay whoever they need and be astonishing at it. It is however aimed particularly at selling second-hand costumes to younger, limited income passionate cosplayers. The ordering product page will list the popular costumes available and their prices to customers under an informative table. On About us page, the site states that it is selling second-hand costumes so that the users get a clear view on what goods we got to offer. </p>
